            This website-hosted user interface (this “Interface”) is an open source frontend software portal to the Raydium protocol, a
            decentralized and community-driven collection of blockchain-enabled smart contracts and tools (the “Raydium Protocol”). This
            Interface and the Raydium Protocol are made available by the Raydium Holding Foundation, however all transactions conducted on
            the protocol are run by related permissionless smart contracts. As the Interface is open-sourced and the Raydium Protocol and
            its related smart contracts are accessible by any user, entity or third party, there are a number of third party web and mobile
            user-interfaces that allow for interaction with the Raydium Protocol.
